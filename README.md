# ProjectEuler
This repo will contain my solutions to Project Euler problems.

Code may be rewritten and reorganised to solve each problem more and more efficiently as experience is gained. It may also be possible to have this repo grow into multiple language solutions for the problems and efficiency level of each language checked accordingly.

Code will be named according to problem number as well later categorised by folder in language. At the moment all problems are in Python (identified by the file extension).
